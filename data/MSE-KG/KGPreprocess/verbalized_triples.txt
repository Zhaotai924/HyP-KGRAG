Material Properties Open Database (MPOD) description The Material Properties Open Database (MPOD) is a web-based, open access repository of quantitative information about the physical properties of crystalline materials. MPOD is oriented to design engineers, scientists, science teachers and students. Properties are generally treated as tensor magnitudes. In MPOD the compact matrix notation is applied. To bring an intuitive view of tensor properties, so-called longitudinal properties surfaces are displayed.

31. Materials Data Curation System description The NIST Materials Data Curation System (MDCS) provides a means for capturing, sharing, and transforming materials data into a structured format that is XML based amenable to transformation to other formats. The data are organized using user-selected templates encoded in XML Schema. These templates are used to create data entry forms. The documents are saved in a non-relational (NoSQL) database, namely MongoDB. The data can be searched and retrieved by a template-driven web-based form or by a RESTful API call. The system also enables the interconnection of MDCS repositories for federated searches.

The solution of continuum mechanical boundary value problems requires a constitutive response that connects deformation and stress at each material point. This problem is solved in DAMASK on the basis of crystal plasticity using a variety of constitutive models and homogenization approaches. However, treating mechanics in isolation is no longer sufficient to study emergent advanced high-strength materials. In these materials, deformation happens interrelated with displacive phase transformation, significant heating, and potential damage evolution. Therefore, DAMASK is capable of handling multi-physics problems. Following a modular approach, additional field equations are solved in a fully coupled way using a staggered approach."

1. SIESTA description SIESTA is both a method and its computer program implementation, to perform efficient electronic structure calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and solids. SIESTA's efficiency stems from the use of a basis set of strictly-localized atomic orbitals. A very important feature of the code is that its accuracy and cost can be tuned in a wide range, from quick exploratory calculations to highly accurate simulations matching the quality of other approaches, such as plane-wave methods.

Linked Data Engineering (openHPI Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)) has description We are surrounded by data everywhere. By helping us to make better decisions, data plays a central role in our daily lives. An ever increasing number of data sources, driven by individuals and organizations, contribute to this data deluge by sharing their data with others. However, data is locked up behind proprietary, unreliable, and even unstable programming interfaces that prevent us from optimally making use of it. Linked Data has the potential to revolutionize the way we discover, access, integrate, and use data; just in the way the World Wide Web has revolutionized the way we consume and connect documents. This course will introduce you to the basic principles and technologies of Linked Data to enable data sharing and reuse on a massive scale. Held together by ontologies, i.e. knowledge representations based on Semantic Web technologies, Linked Data serves as the central building block of the emerging Web of Data.

We develop codes to compute all characters of all symmetries of 26,938 stoichiometric materials, and find 3,307 topological insulators, 4,078 topological semimetals and no fragile phases. For these 7,385 materials we provide the electronic band structure, including some electronic properties (bandgap and number of electrons), symmetry indicators, and other topological information. Our results show that more than 27 per cent of all materials in nature are topological. We provide an open-source code that checks the topology of any material and allows other researchers to reproduce our results."

Access to this abundance of data is only possible via search engines and sophisticated information processing applications. To enable the transition from raw data to well-structured knowledge, technologies such as natural language processing, information retrieval, data and knowledge mining must be applied. In the course of this transition, unstructured data such as natural language text, is analyzed based on statistical language models and machine learning, to represent the contained information with the help of formal knowledge representations. In general, “Information Service Engineering” covers the conceptualization, development, and maintenance of long-term operation of services for the exploitation, processing, and dissemination of information. In this lecture, students will learn the fundamentals of natural language processing, knowledge mining, machine learning, linked data engineering, as well as information retrieval required for the development of information services."

MatDat has the description "Over 1000 detailed, fully referenced and verified datasets for steels, aluminium and titanium alloys, cast irons/steels, weld metals. Materials can be searched according to a number of different criteria. Initial search results are presented in the form of a table from which they can be selected for presentation in form of detailed report or for comparison overview (up to 5 materials). In addition to material information and values of properties/parameters, images of microstructure, specimens and those of stress-strain, stress- and strain-life curves (if available) can be reviewed as well."
