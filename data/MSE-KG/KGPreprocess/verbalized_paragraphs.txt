Material is a type of Class and is defined by EMMO_967080e5_2f42_4eb2_a3a9_c58143e835f9 as a matter individual that stands for a real world object representing an amount of a physical substance (or mixture of substances) in different states of matter or phases. An instance of a material (e.g. nitrogen) can represent different states of matter, where the fact that the individual also belongs to other classes (e.g. Gas) would reveal the actual form in which the material is found. Material usually means some definite kind, quality, or quantity of matter, especially as intended for use. Its preferred label is simply Material.

Linked Data Engineering (openHPI Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)) is an educational resource formatted as academic teaching materials. It is described as follows: "We are surrounded by data everywhere. By helping us to make better decisions, data plays a central role in our daily lives. An ever increasing number of data sources, driven by individuals and organizations, contribute to this data deluge by sharing their data with others. However, data is locked up behind proprietary, unreliable, and even unstable programming interfaces that prevent us from optimally making use of it. Linked Data has the potential to revolutionize the way we discover, access, integrate, and use data; just in the way the World Wide Web has revolutionized the way we consume and connect documents. This course will introduce you to the basic principles and technologies of Linked Data to enable data sharing and reuse on a massive scale. Held together by ontologies, i.e. knowledge representations based on Semantic Web technologies, Linked Data serves as the central building block of the emerging Web of Data." The course is lectured by Prof. Dr. Harald Sack, has a website at https://open.hpi.de/courses/semanticweb2016?locale=de, and is available online. It was offered in 2016 and has a duration of 6 weeks.

The Virtual Materials Marketplace (VIMMP) Ontologies are a semantic resource with the semantic expressivity of an Ontology. They were developed as part of the Virtual Materials Marketplace (VIMMP) project, which creates an open platform for providing and accessing services related to materials modelling, with a focus on ontology development and data technology. Within VIMMP, a system of marketplace-level ontologies characterizes services, models, and interactions between users, employing the European Materials and Modelling Ontology as a top-level ontology. These ontologies annotate data stored in the ZONTAL Space component of VIMMP and support the ingest and retrieval of data and metadata at the VIMMP marketplace frontend. The ontologies are hosted in a repository at https://matportal.org/ontologies/VIMMP_ONTOLOGIES and were published on January 2, 2021, with a citation available at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13218-020-00648-9.
